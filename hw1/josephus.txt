My program answers Josephus problem. It checks for who is alive, then checks every other person and determines if they are alive or dead.
I also had a counter, numKillers which counted the number of people who were essentially alive after the first round because everyone is a
killer sfter the first round. Then decremented by one each time a killer/"alive person" died. Finally I terminate the while loop when there is 
only one killer left ( numKiller == 1). 



I also completed the extra credit which prints out the maximum number of kills an individual has. This was implemented
by using the value of the element itself in the array as a counter. So in my array if circle[ 1 ] = 5, then that means he has 5 kills. 
However, I implemented this at the end so it doesnt quite do it correctly. I had to correct the kill count at the very end in order for it to 
output the correct number. Also the very last if statement is for the specific case of 1 person because it is the least amount of people
and it didnt follow my logic correctly.
