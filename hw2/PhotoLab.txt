Program does exactly what I was asked to do; it flips the picture when vflip is called, it mirrors the image in half when vmirror is called ... and so on..
The hardest part for me was getting started because the sheer amount of functions I had to work on was quite a lot. There was also 200 lines of source code so
I was overwhelmed. I also had trouble manipulating the 2D arrays but eventually I got the hang of it. The hardest function I had to do would be the shuffle. It
was implemented this way because it was actually the easiest way done. First I generated a random number, then I would use that to determine which section of the original picture
I would copy into the temporary array's first section. The sections were also counted vertically rather than vertically like the picture displayed on the PDF. As for the other functions
it just fell in place after lots of debugging.
